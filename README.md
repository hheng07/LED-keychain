### Inspiration

Following along @onionharvester 's tutorial as my first PCB project

### Challenges

It was my first time trying KiCad and learning what a PCB was, although a very fun intro. I also struggled trying to read Frank Zhao's Instructuctable tutorial for the dimensions of a USB- A connector. I found it funny how adding designs were called gerbers, very interesting name choice.
